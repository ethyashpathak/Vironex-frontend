## 🔐 Authentication Flow

ViroNex uses JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens:

1. **Login/Signup**: User receives access and refresh tokens
2. **API Requests**: Access token included in Authorization header
3. **Token Expiry**: Automatic refresh using refresh token
4. **Session Management**: Token storage in localStorage with Redux state management

## � API Integration

ViroNex communicates with a backend API for data management. The API endpoints are documented in `API_DOC.md` and include:

- User authentication and management
- Video uploads, retrieval, and management
- Comment creation and retrieval
- Subscription management
- Playlist operations
- User profile management

## 🔄 State Management

The application uses Redux for global state management:
- `authSlice.js` - Manages user authentication state
- `sideBar.js` - Controls sidebar visibility and state
- Additional slices for other features

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure your tokens are valid and not expired
- Check network requests for 401/403 errors
- Verify the backend API is running correctly

### Video Playback Problems
- Ensure video formats are supported by the browser
- Check console for media-related errors
- Verify network connectivity for streaming

### API Connection Errors
- Confirm backend server is running
- Check API URL in environment variables
- Review network requests in browser developer tools
